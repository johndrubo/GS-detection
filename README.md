# Accurate Diagnosis and Classification of Goldenhar Syndrome Variants Using Photographic Imaging

This repository contains the code for a deep learning–based approach to automatically diagnose and classify variants of Goldenhar Syndrome (GS) using high-resolution 2D facial photographs. The project implements state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transfer learning to address the challenges of traditional diagnostic methods.

## Overview

Goldenhar Syndrome (GS) is a rare congenital condition characterized by diverse craniofacial anomalies. Due to the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and overlap with other syndromes, early and accurate diagnosis is challenging. This project leverages deep learning techniques to:
- Preprocess and augment high-resolution photographic data.
- Train deep learning models (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) to classify seven distinct GS variants.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies include:**
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 741 images covering seven classes corresponding to different variants of GS:
- Cleft lip and palate
- Epibulbar dermoid tumor
- Eyelid coloboma
- Facial asymmetry
- Malocclusion
- Microtia
- Vertebral abnormality

Images have been preprocessed (resized to 256x256 pixels, normalized, and augmented) and balanced using Random Oversampling to address class imbalance. For more details, refer to the `src/preprocessing.py` script.

The dataset used in this study is based on [A Comprehensive High-Resolution Dataset for Analyzing Craniofacial Features in Goldenhar Syndrome](https://data.mendeley.com/).

## Usage

### Training

To train the models, run the following command:

```bash
python src/train.py --model resnet50 --epochs 40 --learning_rate 1e-5
```

You can replace `resnet50` with `efficientnetb0` or `densenet121` for alternative architectures.

### Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model performance using:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model_path results/best_resnet50.h5
```

This script calculates and outputs the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for the chosen model.

### Notebooks

For an interactive exploration of the dataset and training process, check out the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Experiments and Results

In our experiments, we trained three CNN architectures:
- **EfficientNetB0**: Achieved moderate training accuracy but struggled with generalization.
- **ResNet50**: Obtained the best performance with a training accuracy of ~96.8% and validation accuracy of ~76.1%.
- **DenseNet121**: Demonstrated moderate performance with balanced recall and precision metrics.

For more detailed experimental results, refer to the graphs and logs saved in the `results/` directory.
